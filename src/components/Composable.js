      <h1>Composable from the start</h1>
      <p>Curate which apps and flows to activate from our SDK. Choose security parameters, wallet setup, and the native Web3 protocols you want via our API.</p>
      <h1>Uncompromising security is in our DNA</h1>
      <h2>Security that starts with the code source</h2>
      <p>Portal's MPC wallet technology is open source and audited. The parallel 2 of 2 threshold design reduces complexity and attack surface. Best of all, no seed phrases required.</p>
      <h2>Platform security that meets rigorous standards</h2>
      <p>A security mindset at every layer. From SOC II Type II, security audits and quarterly penetration tests to a smart contract firewall that blocks fraudulent addresses.</p>
      <h2>Data security designed for user peace of mind</h2>
      <p>Users can back up their accounts to Google Drive, iCloud or other familiar cloud-based systems for easy recovery. They can also revoke access by exporting their wallet private keys any time.</p>
